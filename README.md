## Introduction

A term deposit is a fixed-term investment that includes the deposit of money into an account at a financial institution. Term deposit investments usually carry short-term maturities ranging from one month to a few years and will have varying levels of required minimum deposits. The investor must under- stand when buying a term deposit that they can withdraw their funds only after the term ends. In some cases, the account holder may allow the investor early termination or withdrawal if they give several days notification. Also, there will be a penalty assessed for early termination.
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit by using the Bank Marketing Data set provided by Moro et al.
